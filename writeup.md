### Resurgence

Last year, Harvard embarked on its most ambitious construction project in decades, the Allston campus of the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS). On a 36-acre piece of land, this project will house offices, classrooms, research facilities, and spaces to foster and facilitate creativity in engineering and the applied sciences.

In Harvard's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?&v=J5Nel0AWDrc) announcing and detailing the institution's plans for this expansion, they say the following:

> "Harvard University and Cambridge, Massachussetts: the two have shared a rich and symbiotic history for over 400 years." – Frank Doyle, Dean of SEAS

That statement is followed up by a complication: **Harvard has already expanded across the river, into the nearest neighborhood in Boston: Allston.** Harvard Business School, Harvard Innovation Lab Complex, and the University's Athletics Complex all currently reside in Allston as relatively recent additions to Harvard's property. Harvard constructed the Athletics Complex in 1903, then HBS in 1927. This was the forebearer to the current foray into this neighborhood, and others in Boston like Longwood, where the Harvard Medical School and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health reside.

In 2003, then-president Lawrence Summers announced a [plan](http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2003/10/22/allston-plans-announced-a-science-hub/) for more substantial expansion into Allston.

> "Summers’ plan calls for an interdisciplinary science campus integrating scientists working under the banners of FAS, Harvard Medical School (HMS) and the School of Public Health—the last of which would move to Allston in its entirety along with the Graduate School of Education." – Harvard Crimson (2003)

The Dean of the Division of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS, before it was a school), Venkatesh “Venky” Narayanamurti, said at that time that ["if his department continues to grow, it will need more space than Cambridge can provide." ](http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2003/10/22/allston-plans-announced-a-science-hub/) Now, Harvard and Allston are giving engineering that space.

As engineers, we should be rejoicing, right? After centuries of being solely focused on the liberal arts, Harvard College has dedicated the time, resources, and capital to engineering. However, the centuries of dedication to the liberal arts, and the emerging dedication to engineering, do not come without negative side-effects.

### Physical Impact

Based on data from Harvard's building records, Harvard University owns **9.56%** of the land in Cambridge, **5.70%** in Allston, and **0.27%** in Boston. Nearly 27 million square feet, over over 600 acres, of land is owned by Harvard, much increased from its inception. 

![Harvard's Presence](images/physical_impact.png "Harvard's Presence'")

Over time, as Harvard expanded its educational scope with a medical school, a divinity school, a law school and more, it physically demanded more space in these cities. However, when Harvard expands, something else must **contract**.

### Gentrification

Harvard is not unlike other capital-rich entities. The long-running joke about Harvard is that it is just a billion-dollar hedge fund with a school attached.

The net assets of the Harvard Corporation, established in 1650, are [\$44.6 billion](https://finance.harvard.edu/files/fad/files/harvard_ar_11_12016_final.pdf), and they oversee an endowment of [\$37.6 billion](https://www.harvard.edu/about-harvard/harvard-glance/endowment). This fact immediately puts Harvard in a position of power in the Cambridge and Allston communities. Small businesses and families simply cannot compete with that buying power, and that radically changes, or gentrifies, communities.

Gentrification is the general term for the influx of wealthier people in an existing space, such that by mechanisms of economic and cultural displacement, the essential character of that space is changed. In this analysis, gentrification is almost always viewed as negative, and is shown to be a consequence of (or necessary for) the expansion of wealthy entities like Harvard University.

Gentrification started as a government strategy for urban restructuring (Haylett, 2001). Former or contemporary industrial/working class communities would be uprooted and "restructured" to serve the interests of upper and middle class people. Now, the dominance of Harvard's capital prioritize the interests of the University over those of the people the University may displace. The result is the current state: Harvard's sprawl on Allston and Cambridge.

### A Different Cambridge

The "essential character" of a space is defined by the people and culture within it. To understand Harvard's effect on the people, culture, and essential character of Cambridge, one must examine the differences in these things over time.

Harvard's growth can be measured by many features, from the growth of the student population to the differences in actual measurements of Harvard's physical size. With limited data on the change in these physical measurements, the growth of Harvard is proxied by the growth of its endowment. The endowment is the primary source for many of Harvard's purchases, and thus, unless through a capital campaign, Harvard funds its physical expansion through this medium.

![Harvard's Endowment](images/endowment_value.png "Harvard's Endowment")

Harvard's endowment has grown, almost exponentially, from \$1.6 billion in 1981 to its current value of \$35.7 billion. Truncating the analysis to post-1990 and analyzing the differences in Cambridge allows the most impactful and responsible insights to be garnered from the data.

https://plot.ly/~hangulu/66/the-change-in-population-demographics-for-cambridge-since-1990/

![Population Changes](images/popdem_delta.png "Population Changes")

With data from the 1990, 2000, and 2010 decennial censuses, a comparison of the population changes can be made. A superficial analysis of this data would suggest a counter-intuitive conclusion: that since the population of non-white people is increasing, the claims of gentrification are unfounded. However, when the non-white category is disaggregated, more interesting trends are seen. 

The Black population of Cambridge has been steadily declining since 1990, and the Asian population of Cambridge has been steadily increasing. The two groups fall under the category "non-white" or "people of color," and are often leveraged for data in those groups. This analysis, however, paints a more nuanced picture about changing demographics in Cambridge by disagreggating this category.

What's interesting to note is that the white population has also been steadily declining. Again, this is not indicative of any sort of "reverse gentrification." A deeper analysis is necessary to extract nuance. One must examine the differences in the people who are leaving and the people who are arriving to understand the change in the city's essential character. An examination of cost of living and median income show that the people coming to Cambridge are much more wealthy than those who are leaving.

Cost of living is well proxied by housing and rent prices. [neighborhoodscout.com](https://www.neighborhoodscout.com/ma/cambridge/real-estate) offers a very good picture of the change in Cambridge's housing market:

> In the last 10 years, Cambridge has experienced some of the highest home appreciation rates of any community in the nation. Cambridge real estate appreciated 62.57% over the last ten years, which is an average annual home appreciation rate of 4.98%, putting Cambridge in the top 10% nationally for real estate appreciation.

Further analysis of census and other data available about Cambridge produces similar conclusions.

https://plot.ly/~hangulu/68/the-change-in-housing-prices-in-cambridge-and-boston-since-2000/

![Housing Changes](images/housing_delta.png "Housing Changes")

The change in the prices of these houses is well-approximated from 1997 to 2018 with a linear fit. One can also see that not only are the houses in Cambridge more expensive than those in Boston (which comprises many universities and a more complex real estate climate than Cambridge), but they are becoming even more expensive more quickly. Similar trends are seen when examining rent prices in the same period.

https://plot.ly/~hangulu/72/the-change-in-rent-in-cambridge-and-boston-since-2000/

![Rent Changes](images/rent_delta.png "Rent Changes")

Perhaps even more worrying is that the median income of the two of these cities is converging, meaning that even though the cost of living of these two cities is increasing at different rates, the income of the residents will soon be the same. For people with relatively low and stagnant incomes, this makes Cambridge a harder city to live and do business in than Boston, and incentivizes emigration.

https://plot.ly/~hangulu/74/the-change-in-median-income-of-cambridge-and-boston-residents-since-1990/

![Income Changes](images/income_delta.png "Income Changes")

As shown above, unusual appreciation of housing and rent prices matched with a relatively slow-rising median income disincentivizes living in Cambridge, and this leads to a change in the people in the city. Communities naturally evolve over time, so assigning negative connotations to that simple evolution is counter-productive and unrealistic. However, a key aspect of gentrification is the agent of change. Gentrification applies when the agent of change is wealthy and powerful, like Harvard University.

### Property and Taxes

There are many variables that go into changes in cost of living and income, so it is difficult to assign a single agent of change. However, there are indicators of Harvard University's outsized effect on Cambridge.

The first is the fluctuation in Harvard's property holdings in the city.

https://plot.ly/~hangulu/76/the-growth-of-harvards-property-in-cambridge-since-2000/

![Harvard's Cambridge Property](images/property_delta.png "Harvard's Cambridge Property")

The graph shows that since 2003, the same year Larry Summers introduced the idea to expand into Allston, Harvard has reduced the number of its taxable properties in Cambridge. Its tax-exempt holdings rapdily increased in 2007, around the time of the financial crisis, then decreased as Harvard moved into other cities. During this same time, however, Harvard increased its payments to the government of Cambridge through the PILOT (Payment in Lieu of Taxes) program.

After years of negotiations, in 2011 Cambridge and Boston established a program to have non-profits (like Harvard University) with more than $15 million of tax-exempt property in the city to help offset the costs of snow removal, police and fire protection, and other services. These requested payments already take into account the positive effects the non-profits have on their cities, and are thus often quite reasonable. However, since 2012, no non-profit in this category has paid the full amount requested. In fact, in 2017, Harvard University only paid [53%](https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/08/18/city-asks-for-payments-most-colleges-don-pay-full/KnZ5ZRx0QMhrB5FA6NJZxN/story.html) of its PILOT.

The PILOT program was meant to alleviate bureacratic tensions between these entities and the cities in which they reside, and offer an easier and more straightforward way for the entities to do business while having a minimal impact on the residents. Yet, Harvard University continues to fall below the requested mark, with the balance coming from people in the community.

### The Agent of Change

Harvard University has a direct impact on Cambridge, as shown above through analyses of its payments to the city and property expansion. The growth of Harvard University, previously proxied by its endowment, is quite significant as well, and also has a direct impact. For example, the superficial connection between the growth of the endowment and the shrinking of the Black population of Cambridge seems quite clear:

https://plot.ly/~hangulu/78/the-connection-between-endowment-and-black-population/

![Endowment and Black Population](images/endow_black_super.png "Endowment and Black Population")

However, this paints an unfair picture. One could argue that both the endowment and Black population of Cambridge could be controlled by some other variable, fueling this false dependency. Hence, using the Python package [`causality`](https://github.com/akelleh/causality) and a random forest regression model, a relationship that is controlled for the most obvious external factors, rent and housing prices, was created.

![Controlled Relationship Between Endowment and Black Population](images/black_endow.svg "Controlled Relationship Between Endowment and Black Population")

This relationship, although noisy, *confirms the downward trend*, and thus the negative correlation between Harvard's growth, proxied by its endowment, and the growth of the Black population of Cambridge. A similar relationship is seen between the endowment and rent, as well as the endowment and housing, controlling for the growth of the population.

### Moving Forward

As this analysis and general intuition shows, Harvard University has a massive effect on the cities it is in. The presence of the University, and its ever-growing demand for space and resources, radically changes the people in these communities, and thus the culture and essential character of these communities. In short, the gentrification of Cambridge is an effect of Harvard's expansion.

Harvard, MIT, and Cambridge are often thought of as one, but there are people within the city that do not have access to the resources of these Universities, but are affected negatively by their presence. Businesses and families have been priced out, making the way for more capital-rich businesses and entities tied to the universities. These universities also refuse to pay anywhere close to the full amount of the PILOT, further offsetting the burden of operation onto the residents.

Harvard University is quite aware of their impact and the possible backlash they may face from residents. Allston residents have long been uncomfortable with these expansions, forcing Harvard to make property purchases under fake names. Former head of Harvard Real Estate Incorporated and former vice-president for administration, Sally Zeckhauser, [said](https://harvardmagazine.com/2011/09/building-and-buying-a-campus) that as Harvard expanded within Cambridge, it began bumping against:

> "mature neighborhoods with sophisticated and politically active residents often seeking to preserve things just as they were.”

This was the rationale for moving to other cities. They had already displaced people who were "unsophisticated" and "politically inactive," which are dog-whistles for low-income people of color, so it was time to move on. Where to? Allston.

The solution to these problems is outside of the scope of this analysis and article, but one can start by challenging Harvard as it expands, and supporting low-income people of color and their businesses in these cities. It is especially important for students, who often only experience the positive sides of Harvard's expansion, to support these communities. Check out Cambridge's [registry of small businesses owned by women and people of color](http://www.cambridgema.gov/CDD/econdev/resourcesforbusinesses/wmobassistance), and find ways to support and get involved.
